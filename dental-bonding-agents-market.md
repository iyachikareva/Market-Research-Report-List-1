<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Bonding Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Total-etch System</li><li>Self-etch System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental bonding agents market comprises two main types: total-etch systems and self-etch systems. Total-etch systems require enamel and dentin to be etched with phosphoric acid before the application of bonding agents, enhancing adhesion but increasing procedural steps. In contrast, self-etch systems eliminate the need for separate etching, combining adhesion and etching in one step, which simplifies the process and reduces sensitivity risks. Both systems are essential for dental restorations, each offering unique advantages based on clinical scenarios.</p></p>
