<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specialty Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The specialty tire market is primarily divided into radial tires and bias (crossply) tires. Radial tires feature a design where the fabric cords run radially from the center, providing superior grip, fuel efficiency, and longer tread life. They are widely used in passenger vehicles and trucks. In contrast, bias tires have layers of fabric that crisscross, offering better durability and resistance to punctures, making them suitable for off-road vehicles and specific applications like agriculture and construction. Each type serves distinct consumer needs and preferences.</p></p>
